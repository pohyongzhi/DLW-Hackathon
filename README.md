## What the project does?
Allow accelerated learning for individuals who have visual impairment, through the use of radiofrequency sensors to warn and alert the user of danger.

## How does Smart Cane work?
It uses an ultrasonic sensor attached to a blind stick to measure the distance between an object and the stick. It will feedback signs of danger through a buzzer back to the user. With additional mobile software (Smart Alert), the user is able to press a button to alert surrounding people for help. The app is targeted towards user who are visually impared and mute. 

## Why should you use the Smart Cane?
It is cheap to manufacture with low material cost, easily replicable, low maintenance cost. Therefore affordable for individuals to use our Smart Cane. It is also counter-intuitive to use with very simple app interface for Smart Alert app and straightforward design for the Smart Cane.
